# toolbin #

_toolbin_ is a collection of my Linux pentester tools that are pre-built (x86_64) for easy access from the field.

**What tools are in the toolbin?**

* [shelljack](https://github.com/emptymonkey/toolbin/raw/master/shelljack)
* [sigsleeper](https://github.com/emptymonkey/toolbin/raw/master/sigsleeper)
* [pretend](https://github.com/emptymonkey/toolbin/raw/master/pretend)

The revsh tool is available in several Arch/OS combos:
* [revsh-x86_64-Linux](https://github.com/emptymonkey/toolbin/raw/master/revsh/revsh-x86_64-Linux)
* [revsh-i686-Linux](https://github.com/emptymonkey/toolbin/raw/master/revsh/revsh-i686-Linux)

In addition, the keys directory that these binaries were built with are available as well:
* [keys.tar](https://github.com/emptymonkey/toolbin/raw/master/revsh/keys.tar) 

## A Quick Note on Ethics ##

I write and release these tools with the intention of educating the larger [IT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology) community and empowering legitimate pentesters. If I can write these tools in my spare time, then rest assured that the dedicated malicious actors have already developed versions of their own.
