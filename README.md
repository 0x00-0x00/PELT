## A Quick Note on Ethics ##

I write and release these tools with the intention of educating the larger [IT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology) community and empowering legitimate pentesters. If I can write these tools in my spare time, then rest assured that the dedicated malicious actors have already developed versions of their own.
