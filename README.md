# toolbin #

This _toolbin_ is a collection of pre-built Linux x86_64 binaries. They are presented here for easy access from the field.

**What tools are in the toolbin?**

* [pretend](https://github.com/emptymonkey/pretend)

## Installation ##

You can grab the binary you need directly. Note the "raw" url below.

	chmod u+x shelljack

You can also pull down the entire toolbin with git.

## A Quick Note on Ethics ##

I write and release these tools with the intention of educating the larger [IT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology) community and empowering legitimate pentesters. If I can write these tools in my spare time, then rest assured that the dedicated malicious actors have already developed versions of their own.
